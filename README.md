General-purpose C tools, vintage ANSI.  Some are self-educational:  e.g.
teaching myself about how various checksum and crypto algorithms work.  Others
I use regularly in development work, e.g. d2h, h2d, jot, hex, and unhex.

* crypto, checksum, and pseudo-random routines
* dos2unix/unix2dos
* hex/unhex
* disk-space viewer
