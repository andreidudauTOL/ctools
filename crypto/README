kbe (Kerl's block encryptor) is a simple little C program to encrypt and
unencrypt files using various algorithms, coupled with cipher-block chaining.
There are already various programs for this.  Mainly, writing this was just
good clean fun, and a way to teach myself various concepts I was
curious about.

In particular, this was about the time that Rijndael was selected as the AES
(Advanced Encryption Standard).  It had been my favorite in AES competition due
to its elegant design, and its use of finite-field arithmetic (see
http://johnkerl.org/doc/ffcomp.pdf).

* AES and AESF (the 2nd one is faster) are two implementations of AES.
* md5 and SHA are the familiar cryptographic hashes.
* rc4 is also standard.
* myx is a silly little cipher I made up (I'm no cryptanalyst
  so it was just for fun).
* binv is a bit-invertor; twiddle XORs key material; null is
  a no-op which I implemented for performance comparison.
